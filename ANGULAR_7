ANGULAR 7

Installation
You're first going to need to install the Angular CLI (Command Line Interface) tool, which helps you start new Angular 7 projects as well as assist you during development. In order to install the Angular CLI, you will need Nodejs. Make sure you install this with the default options and reload your command line or console after doing so.

In your command line, type:
> npm install -g @angular/cli

Once complete, you can now access the CLI by simply starting any commands with ng.

Hop into whichever folder you want to store your projects, and run the following command to install a new Angular 7 project:
> ng new ng7

It's going to present you with a couple questions before beginning:
? Would you like to add Angular routing? Yes
? Which stylesheet format would you like to use? SCSS   [ http://sass-lang.com   ]

It will take a minute or two and once completed, you can now hop into the new project folder by typing:
> cd ng7

Open up this project in your preferred code editor (I use Visual Studio Code, and you can launch it automatically by typing code . in the current folder), and then run this command to run a development server using the Angular CLI:

> ng serve -o

-o is for open, this flag will open your default browser at http://localhost:4200. Tip: You can type ng to get a list of all available commands, and ng [command] --help to discover all their flags.

Awesome! If all went smooth, you should be presented with the standard landing page template for your new Angular 7 project:


Angular 7 Components
The most basic building block of your Angular 7 application (and this is a concept that's not new) is the component. A component consists of three primary elements:

The HTML template
The logic
The styling (CSS, Sass, Stylus, etc..)
When we use the Angular CLI to start a new project, it generates a single component, which is found in /src/app/:


/app.component.html
/app.component.scss
/app.component.ts



While we have three files here that represent the three elements above, the .ts (TypeScript) is the heart of the component. Let's take a look at that file:


import { Component } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  templateUrl: './app.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./app.component.scss']
})
export class AppComponent {
  title = 'ng7-pre';
}


Here, because this is a component, we're importing Component from the @angular/core library, and then it defines what's called a @Component decorator, which provides configuration options for that particular component.

As you can see, it's referencing the location of the HTML template file and the CSS file with the templateUrl property and the styleUrls property.

The logic of the component resides in the class at the bottom. As you can see, the CLI starter template simply defines a single property called title.

Let's use the Angular CLI to create our own components that we'll need going forward. In the console, issue the following commands:

> ng generate component nav
// output

> ng g c about
// output

> ng g c contact
// output

> ng g c home
// output
